# this file is partially maintained by CI; the concourse and garden-runc
# versions and sha1s are automatically bumped, while the rest are preserved
# as-is.

# this should make getting started easy while being easy enough to maintain
# manually. feel free to PR sane defaults along with newly supported
# infrastructures and such!
