#
#  This operations file will configure web to not include the X-Frame-Options header
#
#  This allows accessing the web UI via an iframe, as is done in the Concourse
#  documentation examples.
#
#  There are no configurable parameters associated with this
#  operations file, and it is mutually-exclusive with the other two
#  x-frame-options*.yml operations files.
