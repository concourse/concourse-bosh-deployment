# Cluster Concourse deployment

A clustered Concourse deployment exercises the full might of BOSH. It
provides disaster recovery for your VMs, safe management of your
persistent state (including resizing of the available space,
snapshot/restore, etc.), and in general will make your life easier once
you get it going.

You'll first need to set up the [Cloud
Config](http://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html) on your director. This part
depends on your infrastructure of choice. There are a few example configs under
[cloud_configs/](cloud_configs/).

For example, if you're going to deploy to a [BOSH
Lite](http://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite.html) director, you would run:

```shell
bosh -e $BOSH_ENVIRONMENT update-cloud-config cloud_configs/vbox.yml \
  -v z1_gateway=10.244.15.1 \
  -v z1_range=10.244.15.0/30 \
  -v z1_static="[10.244.15.2]" \
  -v z2_gateway=10.244.16.1 \
  -v z2_range=10.244.16.0/24

bosh -e $BOSH_ENVIRONMENT deploy -d concourse concourse.yml \
  -l ../versions.yml \
  --vars-store cluster-creds.yml \
  -o operations/static-web.yml \
  -o operations/no-auth.yml \
  --var web_ip=10.244.15.2 \
  --var external_url=http://10.244.15.2:8080 \
  --var network_name=concourse \
  --var web_vm_type=concourse \
  --var db_vm_type=concourse \
  --var db_persistent_disk_type=db \
  --var worker_vm_type=concourse \
  --var deployment_name=concourse
```

This should then result in a Concourse running and listening at
[http://10.244.15.2:8080](http://10.244.15.2:8080), ready for targeting
with `fly`:

```shell
fly -t ci login -c http://10.244.15.2:8080
```

## External Concourse worker

In case you have a distributed setup with external concourse workers deployed on another BOSH
you can deploy those with:
```shell
bosh -e $BOSH_ENVIRONMENT deploy -d concourse-worker external-worker.yml \
  -l ../versions.yml \
  -v external_worker_network_name=concourse \
  -v worker_vm_type=concourse-workers \
  -v instances=2 \
  -v azs=[z1] \
  -v deployment_name=concourse-worker \
  -v tsa_host=10.244.15.2 \
  -v worker_tags=[tags] \
  -l <path/to/secrets.yml>
```

The `secrets.yml` file has to contain the public tsa host key of the concourse master and the worker private
key:

```yaml
tsa_host_key:
  public_key: <public_key>

worker_key:
  private_key: |
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
